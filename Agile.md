## 4. Agile+Lean in organization.

>4.1 Agile vs Lean movements.

| Question | Agile | Lean |
|-------|------|------|
|Key Q | How do we build?| what do we build ?|
|measuring success against| stakeholders, users | Markets
|Key values| Flexibility, adaptability, responsiveness | Efficiency, quality, value|
elements | User stories, product backlog | Business model canvas, value stream map|


## 5. Agile+Lean practices: Standup, user stories, retrospectives.

## 6. The Agile Frameworks Trap: When Practices Don't Align with Values.
Agile frameworks are designed to help organizations implement Agile practices and principles in a structured way. However, it is possible for organizations to fall into a trap where they focus too much on the practices of Agile frameworks and lose sight of the underlying Agile values.

This trap occurs when organizations adopt Agile frameworks without fully understanding the Agile values and principles that underpin them. Instead, they focus on the specific practices and rituals prescribed by the framework, such as daily stand-ups, sprint planning meetings, and retrospectives. While these practices are important, they are only effective when they are aligned with Agile values and principles.

For example, an organization may adopt Scrum as its Agile framework but focus solely on the sprint process and ceremonies without truly embracing the values of transparency, inspection, and adaptation that Scrum is built upon. This can lead to a situation where the team is going through the motions of Agile but not truly embodying its values.

To avoid this trap, organizations must focus on understanding the Agile values and principles that underpin their chosen framework. This means taking the time to learn about the Agile Manifesto and the 12 Agile principles, and understanding how they apply to the organization's specific context.

Organizations must also be willing to adapt their practices to align with their Agile values and principles. This may mean changing or modifying certain practices to better align with the organization's values, or even adopting a different Agile framework that better aligns with the organization's needs.

Ultimately, it is important to remember that Agile is not just a set of practices or a framework - it is a mindset and a way of working. By focusing on the underlying Agile values and principles, organizations can ensure that their Agile practices are truly effective and aligned with their overall goals and values.
## 7. Learning Exercise: Solving Organizational Challenges with Agile Practices.
>  
 You are a medium sized B2B software. As a service company selling an analytics dashboard to Fortune 500 companies, your sales team. Keep selling things that your product team has not actually built and does not plan to build, creating misaligned expectations among customers. You don't want to slow sales to a crawl, but you also don't want customers to churn if they were promised something that never gets built.
 How will you solve this problem using Agile & Lean practices ?

 answer :
 To solve this problem using Agile and Lean practices, here are some steps that your company can take:

1. Improve communication between sales and product teams: Encourage regular communication and collaboration between the sales and product teams to ensure that sales representatives have an accurate understanding of the product's capabilities and limitations. The product team can share their product roadmap, priorities, and timelines with sales to ensure that the sales team has a clear understanding of what will be delivered and when.

2. Establish a clear product roadmap: Develop a clear product roadmap that outlines the features and functionalities that will be developed over the next few months or years. This roadmap should be shared with the sales team to ensure that their expectations align with the product's capabilities.

3. Prioritize features based on customer needs: Use customer feedback to prioritize which features should be built first. This will ensure that the product team is focused on building features that customers actually want and need, reducing the risk of misaligned expectations.

4. Conduct regular retrospectives: Conduct regular retrospectives with the sales and product teams to identify areas for improvement and ensure that everyone is aligned. This can help to identify any issues or misalignments early on and allow for course correction before they become bigger problems.

5. Emphasize continuous delivery: Adopt a continuous delivery approach to software development, which involves delivering small, incremental updates to the product on a regular basis. This can help to manage customer expectations and ensure that they see progress and value being delivered over time.

By implementing these Agile and Lean practices, your company can improve communication between teams, align expectations, and ensure that customers are receiving the product they were promised. This will help to reduce the risk of churn and build stronger, more long-term relationships with your customers.

You are a small 20 person business to consumer startup that recently launched a v, one of your new product, a marketplace for bicycle enthusiasts to buy and sell used bicycles while you were adding new users every week. The rate of growth is not as high as you would like. Your team is eager to do whatever it needs to in order to grow the business. But you're not sure what you should be working on next. There are some watchwords here, which might start cluing you in as to which values you can leverage here.
